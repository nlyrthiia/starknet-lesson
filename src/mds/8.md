## Understanding `felt252` in Cairo

**Introduction:**
In Cairo, the basic data type is `felt252`, representing a field element. These are integers ranging from `0` to `P-1`, where `P` is a large prime number, currently equal to `P = 2^{251} + 17 * 2^{192} + 1`. `felt252` values use modular arithmetic, meaning they wrap around when their value falls outside this specified range.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Cairo program to demonstrate the wrapping property of `felt252`. You will:

1. Declare a `felt252` variable `x` with the maximum value it can hold.
2. Declare another `felt252` variable `y` with the value `1`.
3. Add `x` and `y`, and print the result using `.print()` method from `debug::PrintTrait`. The result should demonstrate the modular nature of `felt252`.

**Example Code:**

```cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let x: felt252 = 3618502788666131213697322783095070105623107215331596699973092056135872020480;
    let y: felt252 = 1;
    (x + y).print(); // This should print 0, demonstrating modular arithmetic
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Define the variable `x` of type `felt252` with its maximum value.
- Define the variable `y` of type `felt252` and set it to `1`.
- Perform the addition of `x` and `y`, and print the result. The expected output should illustrate the modular arithmetic property of `felt252`.

**Hints:**

- Remember the properties of modular arithmetic and how they apply to `felt252`.
- The sum of `x` and `y` should show the wrapping around property of `felt252`.
