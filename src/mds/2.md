## Lesson 1

### Rust Programming Exercise: Implementing a Custom Trait for 'Hello, World!' Print

**Level:** Beginner

**Description:**
Rust is a systems programming language known for its powerful type system and ownership model. In this exercise, you are required to use Rust's traits to print 'Hello, World!'.

Your task is to create a trait named `PrintTrait` that includes a method `print`. Then, implement this trait for the `char` type. Finally, use this trait in the `main` function to print 'Hello, world!'.

Complete the task following the given code template:

```rust
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    // Use the print method from PrintTrait to print 'Hello, world!'

    'Hello, world!'.print();
}
```

**Hints:**

- Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces in other languages and are used to define shared behavior.
- You can extend the functionality of a type by implementing traits for it in `impl` blocks.

This exercise aims to help students understand traits in Rust and how to implement them for specific types. It also provides a practical example of using traits to print 'Hello, World!'.
