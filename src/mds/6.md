## Understanding `if` Expressions in Cairo

**Introduction:**
The `if` expression in Cairo is a fundamental control flow construct that allows conditional execution of code based on a boolean condition. Unlike in many languages where `if` is a statement, in Cairo, `if` is an expression, meaning it can return a value. This behavior is particularly useful for assigning values conditionally.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Cairo program using `if` expressions. You will:

1. Create a boolean variable `should_print` and set it to `true`.
2. Use an `if` expression to check the value of `should_print`.
   - If `should_print` is `true`, print `"Cairo is great!"`.
   - Otherwise, print `"Keep learning!"`.
3. Next, create a variable `number` and set it to an integer value.
4. Use another `if` expression to check if `number` is greater than `5`.
   - If it is, print `"Number is greater than 5"`.
   - Otherwise, print `"Number is less than or equal to 5"`.

**Example Code:**

```cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let should_print = true;
    if should_print {
        'Cairo is great!'.print();
    } else {
        'Keep learning!'.print();
    }
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Define the `should_print` boolean variable and initialize it.
- Implement an `if` expression to conditionally print messages based on `should_print`.
- Define the `number` variable and use an `if` expression to print messages based on its value.

**Hints:**

- Remember that in Cairo, the `if` expression can return a value, and you can use this feature to perform assignments conditionally.
- Use the `println!` macro for printing to the console.
