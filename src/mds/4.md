## Exploring Functions in Cairo

**Introduction:**
Functions in Cairo are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are defined using the `fn` keyword and can take parameters, execute code, and return values. Understanding how to define and use functions is fundamental in Cairo programming.

**Problem Statement:**
In this exercise, you will work with two functions to understand how they interact with each other.

1. You have a `main` function that creates a variable `x` with a value of `3` and then calls the `inc` function, passing `x` as an argument.
2. The `inc` function is defined to take an `u32` argument and return a `u32`. It should increase the value it receives by `1` and return the result.

Here is the initial code:

```cairo
fn main() {
    let x = 3;
    inc(x);
}

fn inc(x: u32) -> u32 {
    x + 1
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Modify the `main` function to capture and print the value returned by `inc`.
- Ensure the `inc` function performs its intended task correctly.

**Hints:**

- Remember that in Cairo, the last expression in a function is used as the return value if there's no `return` keyword.
- Use `println!` macro to print the result in the `main` function.

**Constraints:**

- Do not change the signature of the `inc` function.
- The `main` function should remain as the entry point of the program.
