## Understanding Booleans in Cairo

**Introduction:**
In Cairo, as in many other programming languages, the Boolean (`bool`) type represents a truth value, which can either be `true` or `false`. Understanding how to use Booleans is essential for control flow and logic in any program.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Cairo program that demonstrates the use of Boolean values. You will:

1. Declare a Boolean variable `t` and set it to `true`.
2. Create an expression `true_expr` that evaluates to `true` (e.g., `5 == 5`).
3. Assert that `t` is equal to `true_expr`.
4. Declare another Boolean variable `f` and set it to `false`.
5. Create an expression `false_expr` that evaluates to `false` (e.g., `7 == 5`).
6. Assert that `f` is equal to `false_expr`.

**Example Code:**

```cairo
fn main() {
    let t: bool = true;
    let true_expr = 5 == 5;
    assert(t == true_expr, 'this is true');

    let f: bool = false;
    let false_expr = 7 == 5;
    assert(f == false_expr, 'this is false');
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Define the Boolean variable `t` as `true`.
- Define `true_expr` that logically equals `true`.
- Use an `assert` statement to verify that `t` is equal to `true_expr`.
- Define the Boolean variable `f` as `false`.
- Define `false_expr` that logically equals `false`.
- Use another `assert` statement to verify that `f` is equal to `false_expr`.

**Hints:**

- Remember that Boolean expressions in Cairo evaluate to either `true` or `false`.
- The `assert` statement is used to ensure that a condition is true.
