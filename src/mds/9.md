## Understanding Integer Types in Cairo

**Introduction:**
While `felt252` is a fundamental type in Cairo, using integer types is often recommended for added safety features like overflow checks. Each integer type in Cairo is suffixed with the number of bits it occupies. This exercise will explore the various integer types available in Cairo and their maximum values.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Cairo program that declares variables of each available integer type, each initialized to its maximum value. This will help you understand the different sizes and ranges of integer types in Cairo.

**Example Code:**

```cairo
fn main() {
    let a: u8 = 0xff;
    let b: u16 = 0xffff;
    let c: u32 = 0xffffffff;
    let c: usize = 0xffffffff; // same size as u32
    let d: u64 = 0xffffffffffffffff;
    let e: u128 = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff;
    let f: u256 = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff;
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Declare a variable `a` of type `u8` and initialize it to its maximum value (`0xff`).
- Declare a variable `b` of type `u16` and initialize it to its maximum value (`0xffff`).
- Declare a variable `c` of type `u32` and initialize it to its maximum value (`0xffffffff`).
- Declare a variable `c` of type `usize` (same size as `u32`) and initialize it to its maximum value (`0xffffffff`).
- Declare a variable `d` of type `u64` and initialize it to its maximum value (`0xffffffffffffffff`).
- Declare a variable `e` of type `u128` and initialize it to its maximum value (`0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`).
- Declare a variable `f` of type `u256` and initialize it to its maximum value (`0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`).

**Hints:**

- Remember that each type's maximum value is represented by a hexadecimal number with a number of `f`s equal to twice the number of bytes in the type.
- This exercise helps in understanding the range and capacity of each integer type.
