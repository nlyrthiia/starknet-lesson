## Working with Strings in Cairo

**Introduction:**
In Cairo, strings are a collection of characters stored in a `felt252`. A key aspect of Cairo strings is that they can have a maximum length of 31 characters. Understanding how to work with strings is essential for effective Cairo programming.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Cairo program that demonstrates string handling. You will:

1. Declare a string variable `x` with the value `"Cairo is awesome"`.
2. Print the string `x`.
3. Then, declare a character `c` with the value `'A'`.
4. Print the character `c`.

Here is the initial code structure to help you get started:

**Example Code:**

```cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let x = 'Cairo is awesome';
    x.print();
    let c = 'A';
    c.print();
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Define the string variable `x` and initialize it with `"Cairo is awesome"`.
- Use the `print` function from `debug::PrintTrait` to print `x`.
- Define the character `c` and initialize it with `'A'`.
- Use the `print` function to print `c`.

**Hints:**

- Remember the maximum length limit for strings in Cairo.
- Ensure that your strings and characters are correctly formatted for Cairo.
