## Using Structs to Simulate Named Parameters in Cairo

**Introduction:**
While Cairo does not have native support for named parameters, you can simulate this behavior using structs. This approach allows you to explicitly name the fields when creating an instance of the struct, which can be passed to functions. This exercise will help you understand how to use structs to mimic named parameters in Cairo functions.

**Problem Statement:**
Create a Cairo program with a function that takes a struct as an argument. The struct will have two fields, `x` and `y`, both of type `u8`. The function will perform a simple arithmetic operation on these fields.

1. Define a struct named `Args` with two fields: `x` and `y` of type `u8`.
2. Write a function `add` that takes an `Args` struct as an argument and returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
3. In the `main` function, create an instance of `Args` and pass it to the `add` function, then print the result.

**Example Code:**

```cairo
struct Args {
    x: u8,
    y: u8,
}

fn add(args: Args) -> u8 {
    args.x + args.y
}

fn main() {
    let args = Args { x: 3, y: 4 };
    let result = add(args);
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Define the `Args` struct with the specified fields.
- Implement the `add` function to calculate the sum of `x` and `y` from the `Args` instance.
- In `main`, create an instance of `Args` with specific values for `x` and `y`, call the `add` function with this instance, and print the result.

**Hints:**

- Remember that in Cairo, structs are used to create custom data types.
- To create an instance of a struct, use the syntax `Args { x: value1, y: value2 }`.
