## Exploring Primitive Types in Cairo

**Introduction:**
Cairo supports a variety of primitive types, which are the basic building blocks of the language. These include scalar types like unsigned integers (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `u256`, `usize`) and booleans (`bool`), as well as compound types like tuples (`()`). Understanding these types is fundamental to Cairo programming.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Cairo program that demonstrates the use of various primitive types. You will:

1. Declare variables with different types, including type annotations and inferred types.
2. Use mutable variables.
3. Create tuples holding variables of different types.
4. Unpack a tuple to create bindings.

**Example Code:**

```cairo
fn main() {
    let logical: bool = true;

    let a: u64 = 1;
    let b = 5_u32;

    let default_integer = 7;

    let mut inferred_type = 12;
    inferred_type = 4294967296_u64;

    let mut mutable = 12_u32;
    mutable = 21;

    let tuple = (1_u32, true, 10000000_u64);
    let composed_tuple = (tuple, 1_u8, (true, false));

    let (a, b, c) = tuple;
    assert(a == 1_u32, 'tuple unpack');
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Declare a Boolean variable `logical` with a type annotation.
- Use both regular and suffix annotations for integer variables `a` and `b`.
- Declare `default_integer` without a type annotation, allowing the default type to be used.
- Infer the type of `inferred_type` from the context and change its value.
- Declare a mutable variable `mutable` and change its value.
- Create a tuple `tuple` with different types and another tuple `composed_tuple` that includes `tuple`.
- Unpack `tuple` to create new bindings.

**Hints:**

- Remember that type inference in Cairo allows the compiler to determine the type of a variable based on the context.
- Tuples are versatile and can hold different types of values, including other tuples.
