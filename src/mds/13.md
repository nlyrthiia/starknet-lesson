## Understanding Constants in Cairo

**Introduction:**
Constants in Cairo are used to store data that cannot be modified, similar to immutable variables. However, there are key differences. Constants are defined at compile time, in the global scope, using the `const` keyword. They are conventionally named in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE and their type must be explicitly annotated. Currently, constants can only store literal constants.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Cairo program that demonstrates the declaration and use of constants. You will:

1. Declare several constants of different types (e.g., `u32`, `u8`) and initialize them with literal values.
2. Print the value of one of these constants in the `main` function.

**Example Code:**

```cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;

const ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 3600;
const TICKTACKTOE_PLAYER_COUNT: u8 = 2;

fn main() {
  ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS.print();
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Define a constant `ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS` of type `u32` with the value `3600`.
- Define another constant `TICKTACKTOE_PLAYER_COUNT` of type `u8` with the value `2`.
- Define a constant `IS_COMPLETE` of type `bool` with the value `true`.
- In the `main` function, use `.print()` to output the value of one of these constants.

**Hints:**

- Ensure each constant is correctly typed and follows the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE naming convention.
- Remember that constants are declared in the global scope, outside of the `main` function.
