## Mastering the Loop in Cairo

**Introduction:**
In Cairo, the `loop` keyword is used to repeatedly execute a block of code. This continues indefinitely (or until the gas runs out) unless explicitly instructed to stop. Currently, this is the only loop construct available in Cairo, making it a crucial tool for iterative operations.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Cairo program that demonstrates the use of the `loop` construct. You will:

1. Create a mutable variable `i` initialized to `0`.
2. Use a `loop` to increment `i` until it exceeds `9`.
3. Inside the loop, print "hello" for each iteration.
4. Break the loop when `i` is greater than `9`.
5. Return the value of `i` after the loop ends.

**Example Code:**

```cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() -> u128 {
    let mut i: u128 = 0;
    loop {
        if i > 9 {
            break ();
        }
        'hello'.print();
        i = i + 1;
    };
    i
}

#[test]
#[available_gas(200000)]
fn test_main() {
    let a = main();
    assert(a == 10, ' incorrect loop value ');
}
```

**Tasks:**

- Define a `u128` variable `i` and initialize it to `0`.
- Use a `loop` that increases the value of `i` by `1` each iteration.
- Inside the loop, print `"hello"` using `.print()`.
- Break out of the loop when `i` is greater than `9`.
- Return `i` at the end of the function.
- Write a test function `test_main` to validate the functionality.

**Hints:**

- Remember that the `loop` in Cairo will continue indefinitely unless a `break` statement is used.
- The `print` function from `debug::PrintTrait` can be used to output text in each iteration.
