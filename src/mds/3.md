## Understanding Variables in Cairo

**Introduction:**
In Cairo, variables are used to store data and are created using the `let` keyword. By default, variables are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once set. If you need to modify the value of a variable, it must be declared as mutable using `let mut`.

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Cairo program where you:

1. Declare an immutable variable `immutable_var` of type `felt252` and initialize it with the value `17`.
2. Attempt to change the value of `immutable_var` (this should fail to compile).
3. Declare a mutable variable `mutable_var` of type `felt252`, initialized with the value of `immutable_var`.
4. Change the value of `mutable_var` to `38`.
5. Compare `mutable_var` and `immutable_var` and print `'mutable equals immutable'` if they are not equal.

Use the provided `PrintTrait` for printing.

**Example Code:**

```cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let immutable_var: felt252 = 17;
    // immutable_var = 38;  <-- fails to compile

    // but this is legal:
    let mut mutable_var: felt252 = immutable_var;
    mutable_var = 38;

  if mutable_var != immutable_var {
    'mutable equals immutable'.print();
  }
}

#[test]
fn test_main() {
    main();
}
```

**Constraints:**

- Understand the difference between immutable and mutable variables.
- Utilize the `PrintTrait` for printing messages.
- The code should illustrate both the immutability of `immutable_var` and the mutability of `mutable_var`.
